# Evolve Forms

Evolve Forms is a powerful solution designed to address the needs of complex Salesforce applications in organizations with multiple business units sharing a single org. With Evolve Forms, you can tailor and enhance the Salesforce user experience to meet the specific requirements of your business units.

This Fork takes the read only features of Record Fields, Related Fields and Custom Fields. 

### Dynamic Sections

Evolve Forms Read Only enables you to dynamically render multiple field sections based on virtually any set of criteria. 

### Calculated Values

You can render computed values on a record with complex criteria, going beyond the capabilities of standard formula fields. Evolve Forms provides a solution that doesn't consume a field in the sObject's schema, giving you greater flexibility and control.
